> In this work, we propose a novel auto-regressive dense encoder-decoder convolutional neural network to solve and model transient systems with non-linear dynamics at a computational cost that is potentially magnitudes lower than standard numerical solvers. This model includes a Bayesian framework that allows for uncertainty quantification of the predicted quantities of interest at each time-step. We rigorously test this model on several non-linear transient partial differential equation systems including the turbulence of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, multi-shock formation and interaction with 1D Burgers’ equation and 2D wave dynamics with coupled Burgers’ equations.

## Core Dependencies
* Python 3.6.5
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) 1.1.0
* [Fenics](https://fenicsproject.org/) 2019.1.0
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) 3.1.1

*Plus additional standard packages such as Numpy and Scipy*

**Note**: PyTorch <= 1.2.0 must be used due to a change `padding_mode='circular'` behavior, for higher PyTorch versions reduce padding to 1 (currently 2 due to a bug in PyTorch versions 1.1.0 and 1.2.0).
